        <h2>What is ForeSightJs?</h2>
        <p>
          ForesightJS is a JavaScript library that predicts user intent by analyzing mouse movements
          and trajectories. It allows web applications to anticipate user actions before they
          happen, creating a more responsive and fluid user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key features include trajectory prediction, customizable hit slop areas, and the ability
          to prefetch data or resources before actual user interaction.
        </p>
