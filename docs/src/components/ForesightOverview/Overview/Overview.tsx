        <h2>What is ForesightJs?</h2>
        <p>
          ForesightJS is a free and open-source JavaScript library that predicts user intent by
          analyzing mouse movements and trajectories. It allows developers to prefetch data based on
          user intent instead of the classic on-click or on-hover.
